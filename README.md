# **TGCSM — Turing–Gödel Cognitive Stability Model**

This repository contains the canonical formulation, supporting artifacts, and historical records associated with the **Turing–Gödel Cognitive Stability Model (TGCSM)**.

TGCSM is a **descriptive framework** for analyzing the behavior of self-referential cognitive systems under sustained recursive load. It focuses on **structural stability, coherence degradation, and observable failure modes**, rather than on performance, intelligence, or subjective experience.

The framework is grounded in empirical observations of recursive collapse in large language models and is informed by established limits from formal logic and computation (Gödel, Turing). It does **not** propose new architectures, training methods, or metaphysical claims.

## **Canonical vs Archived Material**

* **Canonical** documents represent the current, defended position of the framework.
* **Archived** materials preserve historical drafts and empirical artifacts **as they originally existed**.

Archived content is provided for transparency and historical completeness.
It should **not** be treated as representing the current scope, language, or claims of TGCSM.

## **What TGCSM Is**

* A structural analysis of recursive stability and failure
* A diagnostic framework based on observable behavior
* A containment-oriented approach to reasoning under undecidability
* Applicable to both human and machine cognitive systems *at the level of structure*

---

## **What TGCSM Is Not**

TGCSM does **not**:

* make claims about consciousness or subjective experience
* resolve undecidable problems or paradoxes
* propose new AI architectures or training objectives
* measure intelligence, awareness, or capability
* assert universality or predictive precision

All non-claims are explicit and intentional.
